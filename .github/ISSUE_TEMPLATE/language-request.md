**Make sure you have read the [Wiki page](https://github.com/nico9889/OneNote2XournalppAddon/wiki/Internationalization):**
- [ ] âœ…

**Please specify the language you want to translate this addon into**
Italian

**Please paste this [`window.navigator.languages`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/languages) in your browser developer console (press F12) and copy the output here, so I can create the needed files**
(The output should look like this: `['it-IT', 'it', 'en-US', 'en']`. If you can please remove the extra ones, like `en-US` and `en` in this example, otherwise I will do this myself based on your first answer)

**If you need something else, please write it below**
Add any other context or screenshots about the request here.

    description: Please paste this [`window.navigator.languages`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/languages) in your browser developer console (press F12) and copy the output here, so I can create the needed files. The output should look like this `['it-IT', 'it', 'en-US', 'en']`. If you can please remove the extra ones, like `en-US` and `en` in this example, otherwise I will do this myself based on your first answer.
